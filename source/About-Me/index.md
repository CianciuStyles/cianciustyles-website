Ciao! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Stefano Cianciulli, and I am a Software Engineer. I was born and raised in Rome, Italy, although I am currently living in London, United Kingdom.

My interest with computers started in the early 90s, when I was a little kid and my dad bought me my first PC with a single game, [Megarace](http://www.gog.com/game/megarace_1_2). I was hooked from the first moment, and decided immediately I wanted to understand better how this magical world worked.

I studied [Engineering in Computer Science](http://cclii.dis.uniroma1.it/) at Sapienza University of Rome. After receiving my Bachelor of Science, I chose to continue with a Master of Science focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, as I thought it would help me achieve my childhood dream: working in a video game studio.

I started my first job in the real world as a Software Engineer at [Snapp](https://snapp.click), an American-Italian startup developing a cloud-based platform for authoring mobile application prototypes. My main responsibility consisted of designing and implementing what we called the _build system_, a RESTful microservice written in [Python](http://www.python.org) with the aid of [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) responsible for translating any project into a native Android and/or iOS application, ready to be tested directly onto a smartphone. In addition to this, I was involved in the front end development, written in JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).

In 2016 I decided to move to the United Kingdom and started working for as a Software Engineer for [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/). My main responsibility consisted of enhancing and maintaining the distributed system dedicated to running case studies and simulations to improve the order fulfilling process in new and existing warehouses. It was composed of a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application used as an entry point for setting up and reviewing a new experiment, that would later be broken down in a large set of individual runs of a discrete-event simulation, and a worker encapsulated in a Docker container, installed on dedicated servers and desktop computers, for executing the simulation and publishing its results back to the dashboard.

In 2019 I started working for [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) in the Retail Catalog Pipeline (ReCaP) team, working on the data pipeline (which was part of a larger ingestion system for catalog data) dedicated to receiving, reconciling and publishing on the Amazon website the most accurate and complete information about all the products sold by Amazon as a first-party seller. I also worked on improving the internal web interface used by both developers and account managers to inspect the current status of the pipeline, in order to understand whether the Amazon catalog contained the most updated information submitted and, if not, how long it would take for the latest changes to be published.

In 2020 I started working for [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/) to enhance the web interface that sellers can use to purchase shipping services in several marketplaces around the world, working to expand it to new countries and to provide new services, to introduce a new payment system for the US marketplace, and to resolve live incidents in production as quickly as possible to minimise downtime and disruption for the users.
