Hello! My name is Stefano Cianciulli, and I am a Software Engineer. I was born and raised in Rome, Italy, although I am currently living in Hertford, just outside London, United Kingdom.

My interest with computers started when I was a little kid, when my dad bought me my first computer with a single game, [Megarace](http://www.gog.com/game/megarace_1_2). I was hooked from the first moment, and this has been the first step on a path I am still travelling on.

I studied [Engineering in Computer Science](http://cclii.dis.uniroma1.it/) at Sapienza University of Rome. When the time came to pick a specialization, I choosed to focus on Artificial Intelligence, as it seemed to me one of the most interesting ways to achieve my childhood dream: working in a video game studio.

After finishing the university, I started to work as a Software Engineer at [Snapp](https://snapp.click), an American-Italian startup which focused on developing a cloud-based platform for authoring mobile application prototypes. I spent most of my day-to-day job designing and implementing what we called the "build system", a RESTful microservice written in [Python](http://www.python.org) with the aid of [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) responsible for translating any project into a native Android and/or iOS application, ready to be tested directly onto a smartphone. In addition to this, I was involved in the front end development, written in JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).

Currently I am working for [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/) as a Software Engineer in the Simulation team. My day-to-day job consists of enhancing and maintaining several [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) applications which are used by the other components of my team as a dashboard for the simulations and studies we run in order to improve the order fulfilling process, and also study new configurations for the new warehouses yet to be built.
